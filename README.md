# ML_Integer-Sequence

Aim of this project is to find the next number in an integer sequence.
In the given training data set we have different sequences of integer taken from www.oeis.org, trained the model using different Machine Learning Algorithms. From pattern visualization, some integer sequences were incorrect. Then we predicted the next number in an integer sequence from the testing data set using the best Machine Learning algorithm
